**Datasets:**
- vtefL1tidy.csv has the data for the categorization and ratings of the epsilon - wedge continuum. This abbreviation "vtef" comes from Praat: \vt is the trigraph for the open-mid back unrounded (unicode 028c) and \ef the trigraph for the open-mid front unrounded (unicode 025b)
- asvtL1tidy is the data for the lowback-wedge continuum. The trigraph for the low back unrounded in Praat is \as (Unicode 0251).

**Scripts:** they calculate the relevant statistics and plot graphs for each continuum. 

**Stimuli:** you can find a modified version of the script I used for creating the stimuli on my other GitHub: pandabar/praat
